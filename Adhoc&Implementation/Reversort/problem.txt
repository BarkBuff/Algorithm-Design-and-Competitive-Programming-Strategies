Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line contains a single integer N, representing the number of elements in the input list. The second line contains N distinct integers L1, L2, ..., LN, representing the elements of the input list L, in order.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the total cost of executing Reversort on the list given as input.

Limits
Time limit: 10 seconds.
Memory limit: 1 GB.
