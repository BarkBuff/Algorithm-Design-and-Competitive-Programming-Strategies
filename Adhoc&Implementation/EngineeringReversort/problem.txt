Input: The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.
T lines follow. Each line describes a test case with two integers N and C:
- the size of the wanted list, and
- the desired cost, respectively.

Output
For each test case, if there is no list of size N such that applying Reversort to it costs exactly C, output one line containing

Case #x: IMPOSSIBLE, where x is the test case number (starting from 1).

Otherwise, output one line containing Case #x: y1 y2 ... yN, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and each yi is a distinct integer between 1 and N, representing the i-th element of one such possible list.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them. (See "What if a test case has multiple correct solutions?" in the Competing section of the FAQ.) This information about multiple solutions will not be explicitly stated in the remainder of the 2021 contest.
